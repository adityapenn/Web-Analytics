Celebrating 20 Years of the ‘Public’ Posthuman with Skepticism, Disappointment, and Possible Privatization: The Unending Controversy
Government’s influence on modern technology is astronomical as it is peerless. The word influence is of key importance here; bearing in mind the fact that many government-backed innovations were auxiliaries to their era’s bleeding-edge technologies. Instrumental inventions such as the microchip, GPS, the internet and the more recent CWFs (Controlled Water Fuel Machines), Quantum Computation, and of course, transhumanism, are just a few of the myriad initiatives by the public sector. However, it is seldom that such an institution, spearheading the greatest achievements in the technological industry, also be held under microscopic scrutiny for maltreatment of the same. The records over the last three years are thus shocking to the uninitiated: over five-hundred lawsuits have been filed against the public sector by seventeen private organizations alone, excluding thousands of individuals and private parties. The objective disregard and slackening pace of the government in the handling of its own transhumanism revolution (or H+) puts it in indeed, a questionable light. But to support such a claim, any impartial individual needs indisputable evidence. In this article, we quickly recap a timeline of H+ and investigate just how true the government has been to its earlier biotechnological promise.
20 Years Ago, Today: The First Posthuman
The world was introduced to its first integrated Transhuman, Adrienn. Then thirty-seven years old and suffering from Stage III brain cancer, she had volunteered – in a public and celebratory fashion - to be a test subject of the government’s Transhumanism program. The thirty-day tribulation made Adrienn a fully-functional Posthuman that had overcome many physical and mental illnesses including cancer, decrepitude, precursors to notorious mental illnesses such as Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and so on. Adrienn was now invulnerable to ten times the brute force that broke human bone, her tissue fully regenerative, her memory almost photographic, cognitive abilities exponentially greater, her physicality had become more personable, and her mood consistently cheerful. The most significantly appealing data byte of all was Adrienn’s projected immortality: If not attacked by an unprecedented disease or calamity, Adrienn was projected to live for eternity. However, the implementation of such biogenetic enhancements is taxing by its very nature, and all subjects before Adrienn underwent genetic changes only piecemeal. People were thus greatly apprehensive of a cancerous patient’s withstanding ability, and the government’s radio silence during this period darkened the public’s speculation upon Adrienn’s mortality. Many today allege that this was the first time the public saw the government culpable for mishandling transhumanism - a dubiety and mistrust that was further fueled by leading biotechnological organizations. While the motive of such organizations today is still debatable, governmental secrecy continues to be a reason for alarm.
13 Years Ago: Two-Faceted H+
It is common knowledge today that transhumanism is two-pronged; consisting of both biogenetic and technological enhancement. Governments across the world had so far only dabbled [successfully so] in the former, and had vehemently prohibited private scientific bodies from either. Unsupervised transhumanistic enhancements to the human body, even if done in the privacy of one’s home, were prosecutable under the law. This led to an array of human rights movements – more to assert the abstract prerogative over one’s own body than to transform into a Posthuman – that ultimately failed in their purpose. Governments were unyielding and perseverant, and even leading biotechnological organizations on the government’s good side for decades, had proved dismal in their attempt to privatize H+ advancement. So far, only militaries and test subjects across the world had experienced the benefits of transhumanism, and publicly available enhancement services seemed nowhere in sight.
10 Years Ago: The Government Breaks Its Silence
The only RTI (Right to Information) lawsuit that finally broke mounds of red tape and received a response from the Government was filed in India, and the response was nonetheless nebulous and lukewarm. Below is an excerpt from the five-page article: “The possibility of privatizing Transhumanism is nowhere in the foreseeable future due to the uncertainty associated with safety. While biogenetic enhancement may easily go astray and lead to irreversible destruction to the subject’s genome, technological H+ may contract unfound viruses that could wipe out the entire sub-race.”
This response only led to further outcry and a blowback of more lawsuits and protests from scientific societies and non-profit organizations alike. In turn, governments regressed to their reclusive state and never responded to any allegation since.

8 Years Ago, Today: The Posthuman Aristocracy
	Almost a year after protests fizzled and the world had resumed the humdrum of its regular life, 117 governments chose to celebrate the anniversary of Adrienn’s success by releasing the same program to the public at an exorbitant price. Only 1,072 individuals availed this service, and their biogenetic enhancement was predictably not compounded by technological transhumanism. Instead, the Portuguese government – the pioneer of the H+ movement – surprised the world with an ‘archetype’ of what the Techno H+ would look like. The advancements of the Techno Posthuman were to be similar to Adrienn’s, only exponentially more significant and versatile in nature. In addition, this day also marked the release of the first issue of Transhuman Weekly, a widely successful magazine that continues to be the ninth-most circulated magazine in human history.
Today: Possible Privatization
	Little change has since transpired in the transhumanism movement, barring the gradually falling price of H+ advancement. Today, an estimated 600,000 individuals are Posthumans, a number that is predicted to rise to an astronomical four billion if transhumanism is privatized. Efforts to revoke all prohibitory laws on private H+ have been constant and abysmal, but many private scientific bodies assure the public that transhumanism will be privatized by the end of this year. Their confidence seems unshakable, yet the source of the same unnamed and ambiguous. With billions of people looking forward to the culmination of the H+ Revolution, Transhuman Weekly hopes that transhumanism is made a compulsory and affordable right to all human beings. With the future marred by a possible parabiped superintelligence and the collapse of human society as we currently know it, the only definitive key to the human race’s perpetuation seems to be transhumanism and its privatization.
